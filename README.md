This project is about the identification of the genomic changes in the sequence of micro organism strains. However, we developed new assemblies with sample using minimaap, unicycler.
The quality check of assemblies were done with help of BUSCO and QUAST.
For the visualization and annotation we used flye, prokka and genovi.

group 6 made the repository for the codes we utilized for the sample set of 6.

The codes are wriiten in the respository with file name "final"
